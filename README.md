ProwWayHub
==========

## facebook like java web app 

This project is a response to a specific need. Proway is a school providing one-on-one courses,
therefore, the students of this school dont have any opportunity neither to meet nor to make
connections. To fix this problem,   "Proway" managers asked for a communication platform, based
on new technologies, to allow their students to meet and to connect.

"Proway Hub" is the proposed solution. It`s a "facebook" like application offering a simple
method to authenticate through "OAuth" standard. It offers several functionnalities as
messages/comments publishing, publishing feedbacks and comments about courses, conference system
etc.

Through the "OAuth" standard, students can choose to sign in using their Facebook or Twitter
credentials. When signing in for the first time, the application will ask for a permission to access
to some resources on their Facebook or Twitter account. By providing this permission, the students
can extend their Facbook contact list with new contacts of people they met on "Proway Hub".

For now this application still in progress and the screenshots provided here are just  mockups.
Here`s the link for the source code on Github.

At last, we need to mention that "Proway" is a fictive name but the requirements are real, you
can check the orighinal assignement at this link.
